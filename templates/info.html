        <p><span class="underline"><strong>Food Banks and Our Mission</strong></span></p>
        <p>Poverty in America is rampant, as of 2022, around 37.9 million people live in poverty, struggling to live an adequate lifestyle. Today, poverty takes on many forms, housing insecurity, unemployment, and especially, food insecurity. In 2022, the office of NYC’s mayor found that 1.2 million New Yorkers faced food insecurity.<br><br><strong>What causes food insecurity? </strong> <br>Food insecurity has a plethora of possible factors, most prominent are a person's income, employment, race/ethnicity, and disability.
        <br><br> <strong> Our growth plan: </strong> <br> We aim to start locally, with donors and marketing sales, to spread awareness about our business in smaller areas. We will also attempt to recruit high school students for this project, which will benefit both the impoverished and the high schoolers themselves on their resume. We want about 15% of our employees as students, allowing the youth to partake in this enterprise. <br><br>
        <strong> Giving back to our community: </strong> <br>
        Although our main goal is to help the accessibility of food bank information, we also aim to educate younger generations about the difficulties of food insecurity and where to access these resources. Through this, our company strives to make an impact on children and high school lives about the world around them and the hardships others in their community face.
